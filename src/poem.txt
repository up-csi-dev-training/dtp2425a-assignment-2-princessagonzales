"The Battle of the true Alpha"

"YOLO" said the millenials, and "yeet", the Zoomers cried
"Rizzler gyat fanum tax," the Alphas then replied
And lo, there came a shaking as an ebon spire rose
Upon it writ the tongues of men, their generations' prose

And from the sky, a thund'rous voice called out unto the stone
As golden letters glowed upon its surface, newly shown:
"RIZZLER GYAT FANUM TAX, SIGMA OHIO SKIBIDI"
And all beheld the words embossed thereon in great timidity

With shaking and with wavering voices, the grim refrain began
As all the generations sang the verse at its command
Their weeping and their running sores did nothing to delay
The chanting of that fervered song as night succumbed to day

But rose that morn a blighted sun whose light scoured like a flood
The sky was rent asunder and the rivers turned to blood
Their flesh peeled off in sickly strips, their bones were rendered bare
And still they chanted ever on, the words they uttered there

Until bone and flesh and earth and death were all forgotten things
And still unbidden, undesired, the blackened spire sings
Around it wind the whispers of the souls in its captivity
"rizzler gyat fanum tax... sigma ohio skibidi"
