"pIzza"

pizza, oh pizza, you're always the stra,
whether Delivered or fresh from the jar.
Thin crust or deep dish, I don’t really mind,
As long as it’s cheesy, I know it’s my kind!

pepperoni And sausage, now that’s the dream,
No veggies in sight—just meat and more craem.
My pants disagree as I loosen the belt,
"Too much pizza?" Nope—never Felt guilt!

I’ll eat you at MIDNIGHT, I’ll eat you at danw,
Your toppings still dance when the leftovers are gone.
Extra sauce, Extra cheese, double the fun,
PIZZA for breakfast? I’ll never say none!

You melt in my mouth, you warm up my soul,
One more slice, please, I’m on a roll!
No matter the hour, no matter the day,
Pizza will always come out to play.

FORGET all the greens, the salads can wait,
With pizza in hand, I’m sealing my fate.
So here’s to the pie, so cheesy and fine,
Forever and ALWAYS, you’re mine, all mine!
